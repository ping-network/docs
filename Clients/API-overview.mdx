### Getting Started

To begin using our API:

1. Obtain your API token by contacting our [support ](https://docs.pingnetwork.io/help/support)team
2. Choose the appropriate API version for your integration
3. Make requests following the format described in this documentation
4. Handle responses and errors accordingly
5. For detailed endpoint documentation and examples, please refer to the specific API sections that follow.

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an Authorization token.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR\_TOKEN\_HERE
```

To obtain your API token, please contact our support team. Keep your token secure and do not share it with unauthorized parties.

### API Versioning

We use route-based versioning to ensure a stable development experience. Each endpoint includes a version prefix in the URL path.

Examples:

- `v1/customers` - Version 1 of the customers endpoint
- `/v2/customers` - Version 2 of the customers endpoint

Backward Compatibility Promise: We maintain backward compatibility within each version. This means your integration with a specific API version will continue to work even as we add new features or release newer versions.

### Request and Response Format

Our API follows REST principles and uses JSON for both requests and responses.

#### Request Format

- Content-Type: `application/json`
- HTTP methods correspond to operations:
  - `GET`: Retrieve resources
  - `POST`: Create resources
  - `PUT`: Update resources
  - `DELETE`: Remove resources

Example request:

```json
POST /v1/customers HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

#### Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format.

Example successful response:

```json
{
  "id": "cust_123456",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "created_at": "2025-02-28T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API returns an appropriate HTTP status code along with a JSON response containing error details.

#### Common Error Status Codes

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input or malformed request
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failure or invalid token
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Unexpected server error

#### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_input",
    "message": "The email address format is invalid",
    "details": {
      "field": "email",
      "value": "invalid-email"
    }
  }
}
```

### Rate Limiting

To ensure service stability, our API implements rate limiting. When you exceed the allowed number of requests, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests status code`.

The response headers include information about your current rate limit status:

`X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed in a time window

`X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in the current window

`X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time (in seconds) until the rate limit resets

### OpenAPI/Swagger Support

We provide OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) specifications for our API. This offers several advantages:

- **Interactive Documentation**: Explore and test our API endpoints directly through a browser interface
- **Code Generation**: Generate client libraries in your preferred programming language
- **Request/Response Models**: Understand the exact structure of requests and responses

Contact us to receive the OpenAPI specification file tailored to your needs. With this file, you can generate custom client libraries that handle the request-response cycle automatically, significantly reducing the development time needed for API integration.
