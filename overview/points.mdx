## How Points are earned

Ping Points are currently earned as part of **Season One**. This season focuses on growing the contributor network and showcasing the Ping infrastructure in action. The main way to earn points right now is through active VPN connection in the Ping app. More ways to earn and participate will be introduced in future seasons.

### Basic rules

Every active user earns **1 Point for every 10 minutes** connected through the Ping app. Points are calculated gradually — they update in real time, not in delayed blocks.

Good to know:

- You can farm Points even if the app is running in the background or your screen is off (as long as the VPN is active)
- There’s no need to micromanage — stay connected, and you keep earning
- You can be logged in under one account on multiple devices, but you will still earn 1 point per 10 minutes total (without boosts)

### Referral system

The referral program helps grow the Ping Network and rewards both sides.

- **Invited users** get a **permanent \+10% boost** to their Points farming
- **Referrers** earn **15% of the total Points** generated by their invitees (after all boosts are applied)

Referral rewards are **added on top** — they don’t reduce what the invited user earns.\
Example: If your invitee farms 100 Points in a day (including points from boosts), you receive an extra 15 Points.

## Boosts

**Boosts** are extra bonuses that increase how many points you earn. You can get them by doing tasks in the app.

### **How Boosts Work**

- All active boosts are **added together (not multiplied)** and applied to your base farm rate.
- Example:

  \+0.5 boost \+1.0 boost = **\+1.5 total boost**

  If your base rate is 6 points per hour, you’ll earn **9 points per hour**.
- Boosts are **time-based** — they continue running even if you're offline.

VPN activity only is affected (1 point per 10 minutes).

Referral points are **not** boosted.

### Types of Boosts

There are two kinds of boosts:

- One-time Boosts

Gives a short-term multiplier (e.g. \+0.1x to \+1.0x for a few hours).

- Lifetime Boosts

The bonus stays active forever.

## Seasons

Ping Points operate on a **seasonal system**. At the end of each season, a **snapshot** is taken of all users’ contributions. **Season One** is focused on building contributors network and showcasing Ping Network infrastructure through the VPN. Future seasons will introduce new earning methods and rewards — details will be announced as they roll out.
