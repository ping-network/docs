## **VPNs**

Traditional VPNs rely on large, expensive data centers that are difficult to scale, prone to downtime, and expensive to maintain. This centralized setup limits performance and increases costs for both providers and users. Ping offers a better solution with a decentralized infrastructure powered by a global network of independent nodes.

With Ping, VPN providers save time, lower costs, and eliminate unnecessary stress. They no longer need to manage thousands of centralized servers manually. Scaling becomes simple, uptime is more reliable, and global coverage is easy to achieve—all without the usual operational headaches.

Focus on delivering a secure and fast internet experience while Ping handles the infrastructure. Say goodbye to late-night server issues and hello to smarter, more efficient VPN management.

At Ping, privacy is not just an add-on. It’s at the core of everything we do. In an industry focused on security and privacy, we’ve built a system designed to prioritize both.

Ping’s decentralized infrastructure eliminates the hassle of centralized server management, making scaling effortless, boosting reliability, and ensuring seamless global reach.

## **Data Crawling for AI**

Ping redefines data crawling by creating a distributed, efficient system that leverages user hardware to provide authentic, high-quality, real-time IPs from across the globe. AI companies gain seamless access to diverse datasets without the bottlenecks of traditional web crawlers.

What sets Ping apart is its ability to ensure authenticity and accuracy through cross-validation of data. By using unique IPs from real contributors worldwide, Ping’s decentralized approach avoids detection and blocks that centralized systems often face. This results in uninterrupted data collection at reduced costs, with greater flexibility and scalability.

At Ping, we focus on increasing bandwidth and reducing latency. With a global reach and low-latency design, Ping enables fast and reliable access to geographically diverse data, empowering AI companies to operate more effectively and efficiently.

## **Content Delivery Networks**

Once the Ping Network scales and matures, we are focusing on Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to offer a better solution for content platforms. Traditional CDNs are expensive, face coverage limitations, and are prone to single points of failure. Ping is designed to tackle these issues head-on.

Ping infrastructure operates through a distributed network of nodes to provide faster load times, broader global reach, and significantly lower costs for platforms. While traditional CDNs like Amazon’s have \~400 points of presence, Ping's decentralized model can scale to hundreds of thousands of nodes, setting a new standard for performance and accessibility.
