## **AI Data Crawling**

AI systems require consistent access to diverse and real-time web data. Traditional crawling setups face geo-blocks, high latency, and limited proxy availability. Ping Network enables scalable, undetectable data collection by leveraging real IPs from globally distributed contributors. Businesses benefit from access to authentic traffic routes and higher data success rates without the need for complex infrastructure or proxy chains. The protocol ensures flexibility, lower costs, and broader reach — key advantages for AI companies building at scale.

## **Content Delivery (CDN)**

Content platforms need reliable global distribution with low latency. Traditional CDNs rely on static infrastructure that is expensive to scale and limited in reach. Ping Network provides a dynamic, distributed alternative. As more nodes join the network, coverage expands at city-level granularity, improving delivery speed and resilience. Businesses benefit from faster load times, reduced infrastructure costs, and improved availability — especially in underserved regions.

## **VPN Infrastructure**

VPN services require high uptime, speed, and broad geo-coverage. Centralized infrastructure creates performance bottlenecks and operational overhead. With Ping Network, VPN providers gain instant access to high-performance bandwidth from enterprise-grade nodes — with the added benefit of residential and edge traffic routes across 190\+ countries, all powered by a decentralized contributor network. This setup reduces costs, improves reliability, and removes dependency on static servers. It enables VPN apps to scale quickly and maintain performance under high demand.

## **Geodata and SLA Monitoring**

Monitoring tools need access to IPs and bandwidth across regions to verify service availability, latency, and performance. Ping Network provides region-specific coverage using edge devices — far beyond typical cloud-based PoPs. This allows for better SLA enforcement and accurate analytics across real-world conditions.

## **General Bandwidth Use Cases**

Any bandwidth-heavy application can benefit from Ping Network. The protocol’s modular architecture and hardware-agnostic design enable quick onboarding and efficient scaling across a wide range of verticals.
