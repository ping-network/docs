You can target a specific city by using the `city` parameter in your proxy string. This parameter allows you to connect to a proxy located in a specific city.

You can specify any city in the proxy string. If a city uses a space in its name, replace the space with a dot (e.g., `New York` becomes `new.york`). Make sure to spell the city name in lowercase. If a city is not available our proxy servers will respond with a 412 error code.
