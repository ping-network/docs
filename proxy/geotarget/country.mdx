You can target a specific country by using the `country` parameter in your proxy string. This parameter allows you to connect to a proxy located in a specific country.

You can specify any country in the ISO format (e.g., `US` for the United States, `CA` for Canada, etc.). For some countries the full name is supported aswell (e.g., `UnitedStates` for the United States, `Canada` for Canada, etc.).
