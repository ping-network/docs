### Which ports do you use for proxies?

We always use the same ports: 7776 for HTTP and 7777 for HTTPS. These ports are fixed for this proxy service and do not change between sessions.

### Is there a limit on the number of simultaneous sessions?

There is no limit on the number of simultaneous sessions for the proxy service. You can open as many concurrent connections as your client and network allow.

### Can one port handle multiple geographic locations at the same time?

Yes, a single port can handle requests that resolve to different IPs and locations. The port itself is shared while the backend assigns different device IPs per request or session.

### Do I need a session parameter to get different IPs for parallel streams?

No, the session parameter is optional and not required to get different IPs for parallel streams. Without sessions, every new request receives a different IP address automatically.

### When should I use the session parameter?

Use a session only when you need to keep the same IP address across multiple requests. Sessions pin a consistent IP to a stream so repeated requests look like they come from one device.

### If I run 100 parallel threads without sessions, will they all get different IPs?

Yes, 100 parallel threads without sessions will receive different IPs for each request. The system will assign randomized device IPs for each request automatically.

### How often does the IP change if I do not use sessions, and how fast is the change?

If you do not use sessions, the IP changes on every new request and this happens instantly. There is no measurable overhead or delay for the IP change in normal operation.

### If an IP drops during an active session, will it get replaced automatically?

Yes, if an IP becomes invalid during a session the system will replace it automatically with a valid IP. Your session will continue using the new assigned device IP without extra action.

### Which country codes are valid for geo selection and can countries disappear from the list?

All ISO 3166-1 country codes are valid for selection when devices exist there. Countries do not disappear from the code list, but some exotic locations may temporarily lack available devices.

### Is there any performance overhead to changing IPs per request versus using sessions?

There is no performance overhead for changing IPs per request; changes occur instantly and transparently. The only difference is whether requests consistently originate from the same device or from random devices.

### Practical recommendation for parallel streams and browser use

For parallel browser streams use sessions when you need stable IPs between requests. If you need many unique IPs quickly, omit sessions and rely on automatic per-request rotation.
